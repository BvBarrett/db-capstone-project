# About the final project assessment
## The purpose of the final project assessment

The main purpose of a graded assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed.

Through following along with the video lectures and prescribed readings, you have gained a comprehensive overview of how to build the various components required for creating a booking system that can be utilized by Little Lemon.

As part of the final assessment criteria, you were provided with some sample booking data that you were asked to save to a database. To create a successful Booking implementation, you were asked to complete the following actions:

    Create a database that holds the data.

    Connect to the database using a Python client.

    Create a procedure using Python to react to changes in the data.

    Connect to the database using Tableau.

    Generate data reports using Tableau.

In this project you are required to create a data model for Little Lemon and deploy it in MySQL database. This will include a set of tables to store relevant information. Once you have completed this task, feel free to populate your tables with some records of you own data for testing purposes.

In addition you also need to analyze data using the provided Little Lemon data file.

Once you have created the appropriate models, database schema, and completed the data analysis in Tableau, you then need to commit the project to your GitHub and upload the link.

Your project is expected to include the following items:

    Relevant diagrams and screenshots in PNG format.

    The data model you produced in MySQL Workbench.

    The SQL file of the Little Lemon database schema.

    The workbook that includes all worksheets and dashboards.

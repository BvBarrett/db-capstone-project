## Description 
This  project will design a data solution for the Little Lemon Restaurant. it involves setting upset a database, incorporating `Stored Procedures`, A way to interact with the client and the use of visualization to communicate the data.

Tools used:
`MySQL(Workbench)` - For developing and setup of the databsase.
`Python` - Setting up a client and interacting with the database.
`Tableau` - Visualization of the data.

## Week 1 - Setting Up the Project
To get your database ready, follow the steps:

1. **Install MySQL:** If MySQL isn't already on your computer, download and install it.
2. **Get the SQL File:** Download the `LittleLemonDB.sql` file from this repository - in week-1.

After these steps, your database will be set up with all the necessary tables and stored procedures ready to go.

### Refer to Week 1 Folder for Tasks.
